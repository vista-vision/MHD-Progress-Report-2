# MHD-Progress-Report-2

#Solving the diffusion equation in r.

The first file, report2.ipynb has the following:

1. Evolution of |B_i| with time
2. Evolution of decay rate gamma against t
3. Computation of the global decay rate Gamma, and its evolution against t
4. Finding the critical dynamo number D_c by finding out where the global Gamma approaches zero.
The spatial variation of |B_r| and |B_phi| at different timesteps
The variation of pitch angle with r at different timesteps

The 2nd file, report2bc.ipynb has all the aforementioned components with the boundary condition imposed, which do their job well. Further details are revealed within the file.
